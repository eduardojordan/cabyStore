# cabyStore
Its a practice for app ecomerce

# Build
Xcode 4.2 or later iOS 12 or later OS X 12.2

# Architecture Development and Decision Process
Prepare a simple mockup and icons to understand the needs of the practice and the flow of information in the application.

Create a codable data model that is scalable for development.
I chose MVC because it seemed simple and fast for its execution
Use Coredata for data persistence
Use Postman to verify the data call to the endPoint

In the development of functions and code, it is about working under the S.O.L.I.D. principle, and generate a clear and divided structure for better updating and understanding, as well as naming functions that are explicit enough.

For the whole process, the commits were made using the "Sourcetree" utility available for OS X
